Hey there, fellow creators! Ever wondered how to turn Midjourney, that fantastic AI artist, into your creative companion? Well, you're in for a treat because I've transferred 400 hours of my midjourney prompt writing expertise into ChatGPT. Want to try the AI yourself? Check it out [here](https://zust.ai/tools/prompt-suggestion), but don't forget to grasp the intricacies of effective prompting for the best results.

## Decoding the Prompt Formula
Unlocking the potential of AI image generation, platforms like Midjourney rely on a robust prompt formula as their cornerstone. This formula, meticulously designed for comprehension by large language models, acts as the language through which instructions are conveyed to the AI. Delving into its components unveils the nuanced details instrumental in shaping the resulting visuals. The formula comprises distinct sections:

```
(Medium) (Composition) (Scene) (Enhancers) [MJ parameters]
```
While each holds its significance, the first term has a bit more weightage. So, shuffle the terms around and experiment, overall scene remains the same though.

## Exploring Mediums
"medium" encompasses a broad spectrum, ranging from the classic strokes of oil painting to the lens-captured moments of photography and the illustrative wonders. This versatility provides prompters with a canvas of possibilities, allowing them to experiment and mold their visions with varied artistic mediums. In the image below, I replaced the medium in previous prompt to "oil painting". Study the differences.

## Composition
This section emerges as a catalyst for crafting specific visual aesthetics. Delving into this section offers prompters the freedom to articulate the precise look they envision, whether inspired by artistic genres, specific styles, or renowned artist names. It's crucial to note that while referencing artists can be a potent tool, Midjourney's familiarity might vary. This prompts prompters to engage in a degree of experimentation to align their instructions with the desired outcome. The careful interplay of styles and compositions in this section holds the key to shaping the overall tone and mood of the generated image. replacing the composition renders this image-

While the final image didn't precisely match our initial expectations, there's a subtle hint of the pop style evident. To enhance this and achieve the desired outcome, the key lies in harmonizing the remaining elements of the prompt with the chosen style. We will fix that with enhancers.

## Scene and camera angles
The term "scene" encompasses every aspect of the envisioned image, requiring a thoughtful approach to each element. To guide an effective prompt, it's beneficial to follow a sequence, addressing subjects, actions, props, and location in order. This structured progression aligns with how we naturally visualize scenes, but the flexibility of platforms like Midjourney allows experimentation with different sequences to cater to individual creative processes. Again, using the original prompt as an example, I changes the camera angle and location.

## Enhancers
These enhancers, including weather, lighting, time of day, and color themes, serve as powerful tools to add layers of detail and nuance to the scene. Understanding the significance of each element allows for strategic manipulation, shaping the overall mood and aesthetic of the generated image.

Combining these concepts produces a compelling image that tells your story effectively. Midjourney offers an extensive list of parameters for creative control, with detailed documentation available [here](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/parameter-list).

Applying the concepts discussed above, we recreated the original Simba concept in a vibrant pop art style by refining the prompt with additional details.
